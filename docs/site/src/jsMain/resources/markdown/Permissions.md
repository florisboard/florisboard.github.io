This document outlines the list of permissions that FlorisBoard requests. Note, that FlorisBoard works perfectly fine without any of these permissions, but includes them to provide a better user experience.

The following paragraph lists all permission FlorisBoard requests and provides an explanation why:

* [android.permission.VIBRATE](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#VIBRATE) - To vibrate if key press vibration is enabled.
* [android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#POST_NOTIFICATIONS) - To post notifications such as the crash report notifications, etc. (Since v0.4.0-beta01)

For reference, you can also look up the [AndroidManifest.xml](https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard/blob/main/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml), which contains all permissions FlorisBoard requests.

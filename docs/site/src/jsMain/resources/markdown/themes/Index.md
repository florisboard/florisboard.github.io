title: Themes in v0.5
menu_position: 1
---

Beginning with v0.5, FlorisBoard theme and its editor have undergone a major rework. The underlying theme engine, Snygg,
has been upgraded to v2 and loads of new attributes have been added, as can be seen in
[this changelog](https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard/pull/2855). Major new features were support for custom
background images, support for custom fonts, more granular styling options regarding spacing and textual styling.

Due to this upgrade, themes designed for v0.4 (Snygg v1) are **not compatible** with themes designed for v0.5
(Snygg v2) and newer. There is no automatic upgrade path. Most themes on [FlorisBoard Addons][addons_url] should have
been upgraded to the new Snygg version, thus you will probably want to update your theme with v0.5 as well.

This documentation provides some guides on how to use the new theme editor, and provides detailed information
regarding the stylesheet and its properties.

**Note:** This documentation section is WIP and will be updated in the following weeks.
